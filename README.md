## 🌟 **Why I'm Building This:**

Raised in Boston's public education system, I've been on the frontlines of the educational disparities. With many students getting access to learning resources tailored just for them, a large portion is left grappling due to economic constraints. **SmartEdu Buddy** is my heartfelt initiative to level the educational field so every student receives a learning experience fine-tuned to their persona.

## 🔍 **The Problem:**

A significant number of students face challenges in subjects primarily because the pedagogical methods aren't in harmony with their inherent learning style. Be it visual, auditory, or kinesthetic preferences, every student merits resources and tools designed with their style in mind.

## 📚 **Driven by Research:**

Currently, I'm delving deep into scientific literature and studies centered around learning styles. This research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms of different learning preferences and gathering insights on how best to cater to each style. This ensures SmartEdu Buddy is not just intuitive but also backed by solid educational science.
