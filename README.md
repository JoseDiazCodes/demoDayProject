# **SmartEdu Buddy**

#### **Note:**

This project is currently in its inception phase and is a work in progress. Over the next 100+ hours, I will be dedicating my time and effort to bring this idea to life. What's presented here is a foundational concept, and there will be continuous refinement as the project evolves.

## **Personal Motivation:**

Growing up in the public education system in Boston, I've witnessed firsthand the disparities in education. Not everyone has the luxury of accessing high-quality, tailored education due to financial constraints. SmartEdu Buddy is my attempt to bridge this gap. Every student deserves the right tools to learn effectively, regardless of their background or resources.

## **Goal of the Project:**

The main goal of SmartEdu Buddy is to democratize access to personalized learning. By identifying each student's unique learning style, we can recommend the most effective study materials. In this way, we aim to level the playing field so that all students, regardless of income or resources, have an opportunity to learn in a way that's best suited to them.

## **Project Overview:**

SmartEdu Buddy is a simple web app designed to pinpoint a student's preferred learning style—be it visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. After a brief quiz, the app provides tailored study recommendations to match that style, ensuring a more engaging and effective study experience.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Home Page**:

   - Top: Logo and navigation links (Home, About, Quiz, Resources).
   - Middle: A brief description of SmartEdu Buddy and a button to start the quiz.
   - Bottom: Contact details and links to social media.

2. **Quiz Page**:

   - Top: Standard navigation.
   - Middle: A multiple-choice quiz with a progress indicator. A button to view results is available after completion.
   - Bottom: Standard footer.

3. **Results Page**:
   - Top: Standard navigation.
   - Middle: Display of the detected learning style (e.g., "Visual Learner") followed by a curated list of study materials tailored for that style. Each item has a title, brief description, and a link.
   - Bottom: Standard footer.

## **Why It's Unique:**

SmartEdu Buddy is more than just an app—it's a mission to make personalized learning accessible to all. Drawing from my own experiences in Boston's public education system, this project seeks to ensure that no student is left behind simply because of their background or financial situation.
