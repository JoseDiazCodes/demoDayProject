# **SmartEdu Buddy**

#### **Note:**

This project is currently in its inception phase and is a work in progress. Over the next 100+ hours, I'll be immersing myself to make this vision a reality. The current details represent the foundational concept, and I'll be adapting and refining based on ongoing insights and discoveries.

## **Personal Motivation:**

Having been a part of the Boston public education system, I've seen the unequal terrain of educational opportunities. While some have access to resources that cater to their learning preferences, others do not due to financial limitations. SmartEdu Buddy is a manifestation of my desire to bridge this divide, ensuring every student has tools that align with their learning style.

## **Goal of the Project:**

SmartEdu Buddy's primary mission is to make personalized learning accessible to everyone. By determining an individual's unique learning style, the app recommends suitable study material, thereby offering a tailored educational experience irrespective of financial capabilities.

## **Project Overview:**

Focusing on a foundational subject - **Math**, SmartEdu Buddy endeavors to assist students in navigating their learning journey. After taking a short quiz, the app identifies whether the student is a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner and then suggests math resources that resonate with their learning style.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Home Page**:

   - **Top**: Logo with navigation (Home, About, Quiz, Resources).
   - **Middle**: Brief about SmartEdu Buddy and a CTA to begin the quiz.
   - **Bottom**: Contact and social media links.

2. **Quiz Page**:

   - **Top**: Consistent navigation.
   - **Middle**: A multiple-choice quiz to deduce learning style. Completion culminates in a results button.
   - **Bottom**: Regular footer.

3. **Results Page**:
   - **Top**: Navigation continuity.
   - **Middle**: A revelation of the identified learning style, say "Visual Learner", complemented by math study resources crafted for that style. Each material comes with a descriptor and a link.
   - **Bottom**: Usual footer.

## **Future Enhancements:**

1. **Progress Tracking**: A feature that enables students (or parents) to monitor learning milestones and achievements over time.
2. **Learning Resources**: A dedicated section offering additional resources that harmonize with each learning style, helping parents and students discover further tools to enhance their educational journey.

## **Why It's Unique:**

SmartEdu Buddy isn't merely a digital toolâ€”it's a commitment to equitable education. Drawing inspiration from my journey in Boston's education system, this venture aims to make sure that background or finances don't dictate a student's access to tailored learning resources.
