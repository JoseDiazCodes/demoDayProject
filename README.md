## Development Status

> Currently in development, with plans of investing over 100+ hours to craft an impactful and user-friendly learning experience.

---

## Project Vision and Mission

> **KnowledgeNinja** aims to democratize education, offering a personalized and adaptive learning solution for middle and high school students. With my background as an early education teacher, I've witnessed firsthand the gaps in the public educational system â€” and this project is my endeavor to bridge those gaps, ensuring that quality education is accessible and effective for every student.

---

## The Challenge

> Traditional study methods often fall short, especially in a one-size-fits-all educational system. Students require a solution that understands their individual pace and offers material that is both timely and relevant.

---

## Research-Driven Innovation

> Built upon proven learning principles such as spaced repetition and active recall, our application turns student-provided text into interactive practice questions. This approach ensures constant engagement and significantly boosts memory retention.

---

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication and Personalization

- **What It Does**: Empowers students to create their own accounts and enjoy a personalized learning experience.
- **The Benefit**: All study materials and progress are securely saved, allowing students to pick up right where they left off in their learning journey.

### 2. Excerpt Input

- **What It Does**: Provides a dedicated space for students to input their study material.
- **The Benefit**: The AI intelligently generates spaced repetition flashcards, directly saving them to the userâ€™s account for ongoing learning.

### 3. Spaced Repetition Practice

- **What It Does**: Tailors review sessions to the studentâ€™s performance, optimizing the repetition intervals for maximum retention.
- **The Benefit**: Actively engages students in their learning process, ensuring that progress is tracked and analyzed for a truly personalized experience.

### 4. Performance Analytics

- **What It Does**: Delivers in-depth insights into each student's progress and areas of mastery.
- **The Benefit**: Equips students with the knowledge of where they excel and where they need to focus, fostering a sense of accountability and direction in their studies.

## Custom GPT Integration

> **Objective**: Implement a custom GPT model using the Assistant API, trained on the "Learning How to Learn" methodology. This model will generate spaced repetition questions from student-provided excerpts, revolutionizing the way students study.

- **Implementation Plan**:

  1. **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the Assistant API to leverage a custom GPT model.
  2. **Data Preparation**: Compile a dataset focusing on learning techniques and comprehension skills.
  3. **Model Training**: Train the custom GPT model on the prepared dataset to specialize in generating educational content.
  4. **Excerpt Processing**: Develop a system where students can input their study material, which is then processed by the custom GPT model.
  5. **Question Generation**: Use the trained model to create spaced repetition questions based on the key concepts and ideas in the student-provided excerpts.
  6. **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops to continuously improve the question generation algorithm based on user interactions and success rates.

- **The Benefit**: This feature will enable KnowledgeNinja to offer highly personalized and effective study tools, making the learning process more interactive and engaging for students.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Community Feature**: Create a collaborative space where students can share and access a variety of study materials.
- **Resource Recommendations**: Offer tailored suggestions for additional study materials based on individual performance and needs.

---

## Empowering Learning How to Learn

> By anchoring the application in scientific learning principles, we aim to teach students not just what to learn, but how to learn. This is a crucial skill that will serve them throughout their lives, fostering independence and a love for learning.
